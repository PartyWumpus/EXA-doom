## EXA DOOM
A test game with raycasting rendering


### The map can be customized by changing the worldMap variable.

0 is an empty space, and any other number represents a texture from the texture list.

startPos defines where the player spawns.


### Textures can be customized by changing or adding to the *texture* variable.

'texture' is the characters that are used, 'color' is the brightness of each character.

You can also change the resolution of textures by changing texWidth and texHeight, but this will likely break the texture menu.


### I may work on a more reasonable method of texture + map importing
